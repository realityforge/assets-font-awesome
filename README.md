# assets-font-awesome

This repository contains an export of the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) font icon library managed by the
[Noft](https://github.com/realityforge/noft) tool. See the vendored Noft [README](vendor/tools/noft/README.md)
for a basic overview of the noft tool.

The `noft.rb` file in the base directory contains the code to extract the icon font while the `assets`
directory contains the results of the extraction.
